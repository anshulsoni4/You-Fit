# You-Fit
DotSlash 5.0 

Introduction - From team (17) Akatsuki, I am Anshul Soni 2nd Year B.tech Student from Medi-Caps University, 

Problem Statement - so I choose Fitness topic and I have created a website where users can get the resources for some good healthy practices, and get guidance from mentors about what to do and what to not. I want that this website becomes more and more popular so that the knowledge barrier of healthy food, types of exercises, being well is broken. Because main problem is when we are not feeling well, or feeling depressed we dont go to doctors or therapists, which is why I made YOU FIT, so that it connects all mentors virtually or through messages. We will also provide them with gym workout diets and their plans, plus a diet chart according to their BMI and metabolism.
I have included About - where i have briefly stated that what would be our work with some testimonials to get reviews of past customers, Home - where the user will land and see what this website is for and a link to the app of the same thing. 
Wellness - As being hysically fir is not enough to be in good shape, so I have included this section where people can see some blogs and learn how to be positive and not stress.
Contact - Simple form where we ask email, name and message so that they connect with us and we share them weekly news letters. 

I have used majorly HTML, CSS, Tailwind css for the front-end part and added the favicon and a png image from font awesome and flaticons respectively.

Main purpose is to make more people aware that how important is staying healthy mentally also, because of the growing culture of wowrk from home and isolation due to pandemic most people are feeling exhausted so to be more relaxed we give them YOU FIT.
